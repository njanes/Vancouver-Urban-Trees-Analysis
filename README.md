# Vancouver's Urban Trees: A Visual Data Analysis
A visual data analysis of Vancouver's urban greenery

## Introduction:
The Jupyter notebook in this repository contains the analysis and visualization of data on the urban trees in the city of Vancouver, Canada. The objective of this project is to determine:
1. How the number of trees planted yearly has changed historically
3. Which neighbourhood has the most trees in total, and 
2. Which neighbourhood has the most trees per square kilometer

This project's notebook contains an assortment of meticulously selected, and carefully crafted interactive visualizations to accompany the analysis of data. These interactive plots come together in an aesthetically-pleasing dashboard for a comprehensive overview of the data at hand. Exploratory data analysis was performed prior to creation of this notebook. 

## Libraries:
- Pandas
- Altair
- DateTime
- JSON

## Outline
- Import and assess the dataset.
- Perform data transformation and manipulation
- Create an interactive line plot to visualize the annual number of trees planted. 
- Construct an interactive scatter plot with a regression line to visualize the trend between total trees and land area in each neighbourhood.
- Visualize the number of trees in each neighourhood in an interactive bar plot.
- Create an interactive chloropleth to visualize the density of trees in each neighbourhood (trees/square km).
- Discuss the results of analysis and visualizations, and their implications. 
- Combine visualizations into an intuitive, interconnected dashboard for presentation.
